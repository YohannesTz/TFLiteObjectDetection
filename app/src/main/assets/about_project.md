# Object Detection using TensorFlow Lite on Android

## Introduction
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. In this project, we utilize TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), a lightweight machine learning framework designed for mobile and edge devices, to perform real-time object detection on Android.

## Background
TensorFlow Lite is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, optimized for mobile and embedded devices. It allows developers to deploy machine learning models on Android and other platforms with low latency and small model sizes, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of TensorFlow Lite for on-device object detection on Android smartphones and tablets. By running inference locally on the device, we eliminate the need for constant internet connectivity and ensure user privacy by not relying on cloud-based services.

## Limitations
While TensorFlow Lite offers high performance and efficiency for running machine learning models on mobile devices, there are certain limitations to consider:
- Limited model complexity: Due to hardware constraints, complex models may not perform well on mobile devices.
- Device compatibility: Not all Android devices support hardware acceleration for TensorFlow Lite models, which can affect performance.
- Power consumption: Running inference on the device may consume significant battery power, especially for intensive tasks.

## Datasets
For training and evaluation of the object detection model, we may utilize various datasets containing annotated images, such as:
- COCO (Common Objects in Context)
- Pascal VOC (Visual Object Classes)
- Open Images Dataset
  These datasets provide labeled images with bounding box annotations for a wide range of object categories.

## Methodology
The methodology involves several steps:
1. **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained object detection model compatible with TensorFlow Lite.
2. **Model Conversion**: Convert the chosen model to the TensorFlow Lite format using tools provided by TensorFlow.
3. **Integration with Android**: Integrate the TensorFlow Lite model into the Android application, including handling input data and running inference.
4. **Real-time Object Detection**: Implement code to capture camera input, preprocess images, run inference using TensorFlow Lite, and display results in real-time on the device screen.
